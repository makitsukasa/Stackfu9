Stackfu9 is
- pronounced "stack fuck"
  - 9 is "kyuu" or "ku" in Japanese
- inspired by brainfuck
- not derived from brainfuck

  - sorry confusing

Stackfu9
- has a stack
- has 9 operands
- is turing complete
  - I'll make it ELVM backend https://github.com/shinh/elvm

here is operands
0 (zero  ) : push 0
+ (add   ) : pop 2, add, then push
- (sub   ) : pop 2, sub, then push
= (equal ) : pop 2, push 1(equal) or 0(not)
" (dup   ) : duplicate stack top.
^ (jump  ) : pop 1, jump
% (roll  ) : pop 1, roll
. (output) : input a character and push
, (input ) : pop 1, output the character

jump
	Pop stack top and let this be n.
	If n is positive, jump right n-th.
	If n is negative, jump left n-th.
	(I mean "Jump n-th", not "Jump to label".)

roll
	Pop stack top and let this be n.
	Pop the stack top and insert it at the n-th of stack.
	| a b c d e f g 4
	roll(4)
	| a b c g d e f
            ^ now g is 4th of stack
